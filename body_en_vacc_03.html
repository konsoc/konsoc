		<h1>ConSoc, manifest</h1>

		<div class="block_container">
			<div class="page_block text_block">

				<h2>1. The name - "KonSoc"</h2>
				<p>The general explanation - "Constructor of Social Canon" (a reference to Pereslegin's "construction of
					cultural canon").
					In addition, it is an allusion to Ingsoc, to induce fear of historical memory. Finally,
					a consonant with the word "consortium", which corresponds to the meaning of the Idea.
				</p>

				<h2>2. Economic basis</h2>
				<p>Taxes are being paid willfully. Forcible collection of tribute from the "third estate" is prohibited.
					It is understand,
					that
					salaried workers willingly would not pay their tax money. If they so desire, let it be, but normally
					workers
					are too poor and their cooperation should not be expected. Taxes therefore need to be paid by
					entrepreneurs. For
					entrepreneurs it is normal to pay a large percentage of their profit on their businesses, and for
					personal
					use
					are left with no more than %5. But how does one make them pay, if no one is willing to do so? Well,
					it
					is
					possible, if one understands than entrepreneurs make money off their buyers. When explaining to the
					buyers, that
					they
					can choose who to pay for what.
					When they will see with their own eyes how their money
					is divided, then the "socially responsible" entreprenaurs will survive and thrive, but
					any
					criminal or irrepsonsible trash will end up killing itself. <br>
					In conclusion, strictly according to the joke - "to eat mustard voluntarily and with a song".
				</p>
				<p>
					There are ways of so-called "agitations" that entrepeneurs can be liable to:<br>
					1. Entrepreneurs will release videos of themselves every week, and then buyers will be able to
					view their "Live" and go to those shops, where their boss is more sympathetic towards. The
					more
					that the boss is morally concious, the more he understands his responsibility for everything and
					later can
					make concious decisions regarding where and in what amounts to pay his "governmental services".<br>
					2. Entrepreneurs will in an open and comprehensible manner allow for information dissipation, for
					which
					certain "societal goods" a certian percentage of their proceeds will be spent on. Someone will lean
					on
					sponsoring hospitals. Another will sponsor educational activities. Yet another will
					suddenly
					want to colonice Venus and with his infectious dreaming will be able to infect everyone who can be
					reached via his propaganda.<br>
					3. Entrepreneurs will also be judges, unlimited by any legal framework in the making of sentences.
					However, they will only be able to judge based on Morality, carriers of which they
					themselves
					are. Otherwise, by losing the moral authority, entrepreneurs will be relieved of their
					business, as no one will wish to do business with a crook.<br>
					Nowadays judges are fully and ABSOLUTELY unaccountable to the people. However, when their welath
					becomes
					dependent on their their decisions, here we will find out, how many demons lurked in the shadows for
					centuries.<br>
					<br>
					// The point about entrepreneur-judges - is my personal favourite :) It is also - the most basic
					building block
					of the entire Ideology. Here we have morality, economics, aristocratism and mystics ... Remove
					judgement from Morality
					and everything falls into an incomprehensible mess of disconnected fantasies.
				<p>

				<h2>3. Ethics</h2>
				<p>Base dogmas of the millenia-old historical heritage:<br>
					1. Do not kill,<br>
					2. Do not steal,<br>
					3. Do not give perjury,<br>
					4. Do not bed your close one's wife.<br>
					The result of the French Revolution and democratisation of the last 200 years:<br>
					5. All people are equal in their rights by birth.<br>
					The new institutionalised dogma:<br>
					6. Violent coercion in economics is forbidden.<br>
					<br>
					// 1-5 are clear in their meaning. 6 however is about the point that no one starves to death
					nowadays, hence fools
					can and must be taught by poverty.
				</p>

				<h2>4. Religion</h2>
				<p>Religious text for the aristocracy - "The way of Vantals".<br>
					The main point of the tesis - "you are part of the World and your desires - are the World's desires.
					If you didn't guess,
					what the World needs, then you will be fully punished in justice by Reality.". // Normal religious
					schizophrenia :)
				</p>
				<p>
					My belief:<br>
					For myself I divide 4 levels of sacral reality: My personal angel-tempter, country
					egregor, Soul of Gaia, Law of the Universe. Here is a collection of entities of each level, which
					together
					unite to a single entity of the next level. All together are called Random, because a person
					needs
					a personification of a God. My Random - is simply a reflection of the string of my own reality in
					the
					egregor, to which I belong to.<br>
					Well, and for the masses there will still be Christian Orthodoxy. To each status, their own faith.
				</p>

				<h2>5. Political structure</h2>
				<p>A collection of smaaaall countries of 2-3 million. This number - is the maximum, where people can
					still
					find agreement
					with each other (remember the completely bloodless revolution in 3-million populated Armenia with
					the Belarus
					crap, with a population of 9 million). Then these small country will unite in a group
					because
					it is in everyone's benefit and not because cartels drive slaves under protection of law.<br>
					"Russia" - is not a country. A country with such a name has never existed. "Russia"
					is an egregor :)
				</p>

				<h2>6. The Russian mentality, with their tenacity on the vastness of land</h2>
				<p>
					A group of close countries is an egregor. Like USA, European Union, Russia or China.
					The connectivity of egregor is possible through "natural monopolies", like central bank, railway,
					gas pipelines and
					others, which cross entire territory and they are impossible to break into smaller
					firms,
					in order to compete for their small deals in their local systems. When one singular energy system
					tried to
					divide into micro-firms, s* hit the fan.<br>
					"Natural monopolies" cannot have competitors, that is the definition of a monopoly.
					Therefore competition has to be provided in another, non-economic way. Specifically, in a board
					of directors who are drawn from representatives of each region, to agree on tariffs.
				</p>

				<h2>7. Military defence</h2>
				<p>"The Umbrella Principle", when many small entities organised into a single fist against a common
					enemy.
					If someone goes crazy in some type of Wahhabism and tries to fight his neighbours, then tens of
					other close
					neighbours will organise and will crush the bully via sheer mass.
				<p>

				<h2>8. Propaganda, to whom whatever is closest to heart</h2>
				<p>
					Monarchists - because of aristocracy<br>
					Communists - because of sociality<br>
					Liberals - because of economical freedom and liberty<br>
					Nationalists - because of sharing same spiritual, cultural and moral values between people.<br>
					The Christian Orthodox, Pagans, Buddhists, schizoterics like me - because of spirituality.<br>
					<br>
					I.e. it is an all-inclusive Idea, where everyone will find their right and necessary place.
				</p>

				<h2> 9. Practical agitation </h2>
				<p> The "siloviks", who have sworn to protect the people, actually live by banditry, from the plunder of
					the people. "Siloviks" receive salaries from the state, which collects money from taxes, which, on
					in fact, just a legalized robbery. <br>
					<span class="tw-bold"> Banditry </span> - <span class="tst-italic"> is the taking of money by an
						organized group of persons under threat and / or with the use of armed violence. </span> <br>
					It is not at all clear how legalized "tax collection" differs from banditry. <br>
					<br>
					Concentration camps were also under the law. <br>
					CONCENTRATION CAMPS. SLAVERY. GULAGS. UNIT 731. HUNGERS. WERE. ALSO. BY. THE. LAW.
				</p>

				<h2> 10. Morality and legality </h2>
				<p> More or less homogeneous morality can only be within the boundaries of a 2-3 million community. And
					on borders, where morality changes, "stability" is ensured by interstate agreements, i.e. by laws.
				</p>

				<h2> 11. "How the courts will work under Anarcho-capitalism" </h2>
				<p> 1. It is up to entrepreneurs to judge by their own personal preference and prejudice. Entrepreneurs
					are responsible for their judgment by their own business and reputation. Entrepreneurs do not have a
					legal education, so they will not be able to hide behind volumes of criminal codes. <br>
					2. How the judicial hierarchy will be organized is decided according to local conditions. Somewhere
					the Judge of Last Instance will be elected by popular vote. Somewhere the highest judicial body will
					be the Council of Elders. And somewhere they will live at stake, when, as decided by the gathering
					of the community, then so it will finally be. And the whole crowd will not gather again in this case
					... Everything is very diverse and it is impossible to give a uniform template for the entire
					diversity of cultures. <br>
					For example, I do not know what is going on in the Sharia court. Even more, I don't understand Islam
					at all. Islam for me is some kind of pile of ... mmm ... abstractions? sophisms? aphorisms?
					quatrains? some kind of medieval obscurantism? .. No, I don't understand) <br>

				<h2> 12. "Human rights and freedoms" </h2>
				<p> The guarantee of rights and freedoms must be realized at the physical level. For example, freedom of
					speech is guaranteed by anonymity, not by the schizophrenic law: "You can say everything except what
					is prohibited."
				</p>

				<h2> 13. Education of aristocrats and subjects (subordinates, followers, adherents ...)</h2>

				<p> Buyers with their money express their approval or disapproval of the behavior of aristocratic
					entrepreneurs. Buyers decide who to live and prosper, and who to beg through the crossings, forever
					bearing repentance for their sins. Both their sins and the sins of their parents. </p>

				<h2> 14. Infrastructure Implementation </h2>
				<p> For those who will create clones, copy-paste forks, I recommend paying 0.5% of income to the
					<i>"master node" of the Network</i> /* profit = income - expenses */. Because: <br>
					1. It is necessary to maintain the coherence of the System. The human psyche is geared towards
					hierarchy. Public statements today are worthless, they have completely depreciated and lost
					meaningful meaning, unlike real money transfers. At the UN, all participating countries pay their
					membership and crookedly large-scale wars in the world are not present, when the alliance of some
					countries is against about the same strength of another alliance) <br>
					2. I want Russia to finally receive rewards for all its sufferings, both in the past and the current
					century... <br>
					3. It is a shame that the writer of Capital, who saw the root and essence of capitalism, died in
					poverty and neglect.
				</p>
				<p>
					Well, that's all ... To put it very, very briefly and only the most important things.
